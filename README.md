# Catholic Coin

Founded in 2018 for Catholic investors, our foundation is a non-profit built upon the bedrock of charitable giving and digital currencies. Thatâ€™s why we want to leverage blockchain technology in accomplishing various charity-driven projects that support good causes and emancipate humanitarian initiatives.
